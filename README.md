# Violation_Dashboard
<b>Dashboardv3.ipynb</b> is an IPython Notebook featuring a "Violations Dashboard" that allows users to input the Cuisine Type, ZIP Code, and Building Type of a restaurant, and then observe relevant violation statistics related to similar restaurants. The goal of this dashboard is to help NYC restaurants be better informed about potential violations they may incur, helping them to avoid costly fines.

<b>NYC_FB_Final.csv</b> is a csv file containing restaurant violation data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).

<b>DOB_freq.csv</b> is a csv file containing restaurant violation data from the Department of Buildings (DOB).

<b>FDNY_freq_new.csv</b> is a csv file containing restaurant violation data from the Fire Department of New York (FDNY).
